Find Germplasm of Interest in Trait Distribution Chart
========================================================

This lesson will teach you how to find the phenotype for a specific germplasm of interest in relation to other germplasm measured within an experiment. For example, this tutorial could be used to determine if a given germplasm is early or late flowering within a diversity panel.

	.. note::

		Background:
		 - `Violing Plots 101 <https://mode.com/blog/violin-plot-examples/>`_
		 - :doc:`/user_guide/visualize_data`

		Questions:
		 - What is the phenotype for Germplasm A?
		 - Is the phenotype for germplasm A within the median for a given experiment?
		 - Is the phenotype for germplasm A rare?

1. Find your germplasm of interest
-----------------------------------

2. On the germplasm page, select the phenotype pane.
-----------------------------------------------------

3. Analyze the chart to determine the phenotype for that germplasm.
