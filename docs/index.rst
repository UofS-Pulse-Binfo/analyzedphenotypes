Analyzed Phenotypes: Available Documentation
===============================================

This module provides support and visualization for partially analyzed data stored in a modified GMOD Chado schema. It is meant to support large scale phenotypic data through backwards compatible improvements to the Chado schema including the addition of a project and stock foreign key to the existing phenotype table, optimized queries and well-choosen indexes.
