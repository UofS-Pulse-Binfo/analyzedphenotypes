Where is the Configuration?
-------------------------------

All of the following field configuration assumes you are on the "Manage Fields" or "Manage Display" pages for the tripal content type you are configuring. Specifically, this means that for Traits you would go to Administration » Structure » Tripal Content Types and then click on either the "Manage Fields" or "Manage Display" links on the same line as "Trait".
