
This branch represents the incomplete beginnings of a Tripal 2 compatible Analyzed Phenotypes module. It has since been abandoned in favour of Tripal 3 development. Since all of this code is specific to node pages which are no longer being used in Tripal 3, none of this code is moving forward. However, this work will be consulted and parts of it copied when working with Tripal 3 fields in the future.
